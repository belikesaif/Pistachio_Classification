# Pistachio Classification

## Abstract:
The dataset focuses on binary classification of two categories:

1. Kirmizi Pistachio
2. Siit Pistachio

It comprises 16 distinct attributes describing their area, perimeter, roundness, major and minor axes lengths, eccentricity, solidity, convex area, extent, aspect ratio, roundness, compactness, and various shape factors. In total, there are 2168 distinguishable entries in the dataset. The main objective of this dataset is to develop a binary classification model capable of accurately differentiating between the two types of pistachios based on these geometric attributes.

## Label:
It contains a single label:

1. Class: A binomial attribute with two types: "Kirmizi_Pistachio" and "Siit_Pistachio."

## Attributes:

The dataset includes 16 attributes (columns) for each data entry. Here's a brief description of these attributes:

1. id: An identifier for each data entry.
2. Area: Area of the pistachio.
3. Perimeter: Perimeter of the pistachio.
4. Major_axis: Length of the major axis.
5. Minor_axis: Length of the minor axis.
6. Eccentricity: Measure of how elongated or stretched the pistachio is.
7. Eqdiasq: Equivalent diameter squared.
8. Solidity: A measure of how solid or compact the pistachio's shape is.
9. Convex_area: Area of the pistachio's convex hull (the smallest convex shape that encloses the pistachio).
10. Extent: A measure of how spread out or filled the area is within the pistachio's boundary.
11. Aspect_Ratio: The ratio of major axis length to minor axis length, indicating the pistachio's elongation.
12. Roundness: Measure of how round or circular the pistachio is.
13. Compactness: Measure of how compact or dense the pistachio is.
14. Shapefactor_1: Shape factor related to the pistachio's geometry.
15. Shapefactor_2: Another shape factor related to the pistachio's geometry.
16. Shapefactor_3: Another shape factor related to the pistachio's geometry.
17. Shapefactor_4: One more shape factor related to the pistachio's geometry.
